README: GWAS Power Simulation Results (v3)
This document explains the structure and meaning of the columns in the raw_simulation_results.tsv file generated by the gwas_power_simulation_v7.R script.

Overview
The raw_simulation_results.tsv file contains the detailed, unsummarized output from every single simulation run. Each row represents one independent simulation replicate for a specific set of parameters and analysis methods.

I. Simulation Parameter Columns
scenario_name: The antigen scenario being simulated.

high_separation: Clear separation between seronegative/positive MFI distributions.

low_separation: Significant overlap between the distributions.

low_separation_truncated: The low_separation scenario with left-truncation to mimic a limit of detection.

beta: The true log-odds ratio for the SNP's effect on serostatus.

gamma: The true effect size for the SNP's effect on antibody level.

sim_id: The simulation replicate number (from 1 to N_SIMULATIONS).

II. Raw Result Columns
Result columns follow the naming convention: prefix_effect_method

1. Prefixes & Effects
p_: The p-value for the SNP coefficient.

est_: The estimated effect size (coefficient) for the SNP.

se_: The standard error of the estimated effect size.

_beta_: Refers to the analysis of serostatus.

_gamma_: Refers to the analysis of antibody level.

2. The Four Analysis Methods
This is the most important part of the simulation. Each method represents a different analytical strategy.

_true (Gold Standard):

What it is: A theoretical benchmark that uses the true, simulated serostatus (S_true) for analysis.

It represents: A perfect diagnostic test. This is our "best-case" scenario.

_soft (Mixture Model):

What it is: An unsupervised method that fits a skew-t mixture model to the MFI data. It uses the resulting probabilities (a "soft" classification) for analysis.

It represents: The adaptive, data-driven approach we are primarily interested in.

_valley (Per-Sample Valley Cutoff):

What it is: An unsupervised method that finds a hard cutoff for each sample by locating the "valley" in the density plot of the MFI data.

It represents: A naive but common real-world approach where a researcher tries to find a "natural" split in their data without an external reference. This method risks overfitting.

_external (Noisy External Cutoff):

What it is: A hard cutoff derived from a small (N=300), separate, and noisy "calibration panel" simulated alongside the main sample.

It represents: The common practice of using a pre-established, imperfect cutoff from a previous study. This method risks systematic misclassification.

Examples
p_beta_valley: The p-value for the serostatus (beta) effect, estimated using the Per-Sample Valley Cutoff method.

est_gamma_external: The estimated effect size for the IgG level (gamma) effect, estimated using the Noisy External Cutoff method.
